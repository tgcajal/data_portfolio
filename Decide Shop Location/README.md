# How to decide where to locate your new shop with Python

This project is meant to help you decide what property to rent in your city to have your new shop optimally located. This example is for the city of Barcelona, and the shop type is a clothing store. 
The input files are:
* City demographics data by neighborhood
* Dataset containing the relevant shop types in the city with an address

Feel free to run the notebook replacing our data with your own city coordinates if you have the data for your city! Otherwise, you can use snippets of this code to visualize rentals in your area, commercial or not. Our method is based on Krugman's New Economic Geography, for reference: https://books.google.com/books?id=AQDodCHOgJYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=krugman+new+economic+geography&hl=es-419&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwirqtGz8pT3AhX_QzABHZj4DQYQ6AF6BAgDEAI.

I am also including my extremely simple yet handy BeautifulSoup template, on which I base all of my web scraping projects. 

This project was made in collaboration with Data Scientist Vladislav Kaleev.
